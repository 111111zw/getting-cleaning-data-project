# Code Book: Tidy Human Activity Recognition Dataset

## Study Design
The original experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers aged 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist.

## Data Collection
Using the smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz.

## Variables in the Tidy Dataset

### Identifier Variables
- `subject` - Integer (1-30) representing the study participant
- `activity` - Factor with 6 levels describing the activity performed:
  - WALKING
  - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  - SITTING
  - STANDING
  - LAYING

### Measurement Variables
All measurement variables represent the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The original measurements were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

The variable names follow this pattern:
- Time/Frequency domain signals
- Body/Gravity acceleration signals
- Accelerometer/Gyroscope measurements
- Mean/Standard deviation
- X/Y/Z axial directions

### Variable Name Components
- `Time` = Time domain signals
- `Frequency` = Frequency domain signals (after FFT)
- `Body` = Body motion components
- `Gravity` = Gravity acceleration components
- `Accelerometer` = Accelerometer measurements
- `Gyroscope` = Gyroscope measurements
- `Mean` = Mean values
- `Std` = Standard deviation values
- `X`, `Y`, `Z` = 3-axial signals in X, Y, and Z directions

## Data Transformations Performed
1. **Merging**: Training and test sets were combined
2. **Extraction**: Only mean and standard deviation variables were kept
3. **Descriptive Naming**: Activity codes were replaced with descriptive labels
4. **Variable Cleaning**: Variable names were made more readable
5. **Summarization**: Averages were calculated for each subject-activity combination
