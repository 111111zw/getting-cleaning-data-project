# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones - Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project processes raw data from smartphone sensors to create a tidy dataset suitable for analysis.

## Files in this Repository
- `run_analysis.R` - Main analysis script that processes the data
- `tidy_data.txt` - Final tidy dataset (generated by the script)
- `README.md` - This file, explaining the project
- `CodeBook.md` - Description of variables and transformations

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Ensure you have R installed on your computer
2. Open RStudio or your preferred R environment
3. Set your working directory to where you want the files
4. Run the script: `source("run_analysis.R")`

## What the Script Does
The `run_analysis.R` script performs the following steps:

1. **Downloads and extracts data** - Automatically downloads the dataset if not present
2. **Reads data files** - Loads training and test datasets, feature names, and activity labels
3. **Merges datasets** - Combines training and test sets into one dataset
4. **Extracts measurements** - Keeps only mean and standard deviation measurements
5. **Uses descriptive names** - Replaces activity codes with descriptive names
6. **Cleans variable names** - Makes variable names more readable
7. **Creates summary dataset** - Calculates averages for each variable by subject and activity
8. **Saves results** - Outputs the final tidy dataset to `tidy_data.txt`
